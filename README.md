# logger

logger is a simple logger that logs things to the console.

sometimes you just need a really simple logger to track things, and thats what this is.

there are only four simple methods that each log with color, because color is cool.

```js
const logger = require("@aeroware/logger");

logger.success("SUCCESS");
logger.info("INFORMATION");
logger.warn("WARNING");
logger.error("ERROR");
```
